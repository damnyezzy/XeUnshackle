Hi, I'm just asking to compile this for me, it's a change to the success screen I made, I put one I found on YouTube. (if this go to the original project, I'm sorry I'm new to Github, I'm still figuring things out)



I didn't change anything in the original files. Just a change in the success screen. I'm just asking to compile to .xex

The reason I didn't do this? I don't have a PC, I only have a cell phone, and compiling using a cell phone is a lot of work and there's no guarantee that I'll succeed.
